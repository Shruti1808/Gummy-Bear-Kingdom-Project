# Gummy-Bear-Kingdom-Project
Independent Project Using ASP.NET MVC  Dated: April 21, 2017
Site Specs
Database

Your database should be built code-first. We want to have simple setup on the Gummi Bear Kingdom servers, so you'll need to have a simple database migration set up, and ready to run.

Landing page

This is the main page, which includes some information about Gummi Bear Kingdom, and allows access to other areas of the site.

Products

The Products section should contain a list of products offered by Gummi Bear Kingdom. You should add a few "dummy" products, but don't need to add too many. The Products listed should each link to a Details page when clicked on. Products must have a name, cost and country of origin Within the details page, the admins want their product managers to be able to view, add, edit and remove products. You have some freedom to decide how that will work.

Further Exploration
If you have time, consider adding additional features, such as:

Add a Blog section, where contributors may post text posts discussing chosen topics. Posts should have a title, author and text-body. The newest blog post should appear at the top of the blog page.
Including images across the site, including images for Products. You can use URLs (easiest) or pursue research and discover how to include images in your database (harder).
